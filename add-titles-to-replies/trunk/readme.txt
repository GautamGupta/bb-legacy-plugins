== Installation ==

The installation instructions mostly involve editing templates and were getting too long to display here. Please find full installation instructions in the 'installation.txt' file included in this plugin package.

== Configuration ==

None really; you can configure how many replies to show in the latest discussion in the template functions as explained in the installation instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Now that two plugins are combined ("Latest Replies" combined with "Add Titles to Replies") do I need to make any template changes. =

No, not at all, the two plugins have literally just been plumped together. All you have to do is delete the old "lastest-replies.php" plugin to avoid conflict.

= I'm using another plugin to cross-post WordPress posts to bbPress topics, but it doesn't seem to work with this plugin, why? =

Probably because we have added an extra field to the database that your cross-post plugin does not account for.  For now there is no solution, but it is being worked on.
