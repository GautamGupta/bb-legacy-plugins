=== Admin Can Post Anything ===

Requires at least: 0.8
Tested up to: 0.8.2.1
Stable tag: trunk

Allows keymaster/administrators to post any content regardless of tag restrictions for other users.

== Description ==

With this plugin, keymaster/administrators may include any markup in their posts.  
All checks are removed for content - autop still runs after post for formatting.
For example, you could post youtube embed code without bbPress stripping it.

Version 0.04 includes untested code to allow compatibility with the "allow images" plugin.
It's safe to remove "allow image" filters because this only happens if admin are trying to post.

== Installation ==

Add the `admin-can-post-anything.php` file to bbPress' `my-plugins/` directory.

== Version History ==

Version 0.04 (2007-07-15)

* attempt at co-existance with "allow images" plugin
