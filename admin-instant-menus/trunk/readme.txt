* Conversion (with many additional code and CSS tweaks) from WordPress based on <a href="http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-admin-menu-drop-down-css/">Ozh</a>'s original. 

* <a href="http://planetozh.com/download/plugins/wordpress-admin-dropdown-menu-demo.html">demo of WordPress version to get an idea</a>
