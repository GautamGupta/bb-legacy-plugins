== Description ==

**Gravatar - Globally recognized + bbPress = Bavatar**

Users can upload avatars to the forum, which are automatically resized and cached.

Non-images cannot be uploaded.

== Installation ==

1. If you don't want the avatar max filesize to be 50KiB (less than 5% of a megabyte but still plenty), edit the bavatars.php file.
1. Upload the entire `bavatars` plugin to the `my-plugins` directory of your bbPress installation. If you don't have one, create it!
1. Activate the plugin in your administration panel.
