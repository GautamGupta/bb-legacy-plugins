Opens external links in a new window, keeping your bbPress page in the browser so you don't lose surfers to another site.

== Description ==
The BB Open in New Window Plugin Plugin uses JavaScript to target external links to a new browser window, leaving your forum page open. Since it uses javascript, it targets more links than using a plugin that filter pages and rewrite the link. 
Due to the limitations of  javascript it will not be able target links in iframes such as Adsense and some other affiliate links.
The javascript could have easily been included in a theme, but this makes management convenient.


== Installation ==
