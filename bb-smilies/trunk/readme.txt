Builds on work by Alex King (WP Grins) and Matt Read (More Smilies).

== Installation ==

* Add entire folder `bb-smilies` to bbPress' `my-plugins/` directory and activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get different smilies? =

* BB-Smilies uses the smilies packages from "More Smilies" by Matt Read (and continued by Ricardo González)
Extract the other sets from "Smilies Themer" http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/smilies-themer.zip
or the older "More Smilies" http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/more-smilies.zip
Or build your own. Just make sure you follow the style in `package-config.php`
