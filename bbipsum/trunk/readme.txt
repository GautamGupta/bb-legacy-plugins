== Description ==
When you're developing the next big thing, sometimes you need a forum full of gibberish. bbIpsum does just that.

This plugin is primarily useful for plugin and theme developers who need a forum with posts in it but don't want to spend time doing it themselves.

You can choose between Lorem Ipsum, asdfjkl, Aroodles, and Pikachu style gibberish. Then you can select the number of users, posts, and topics to add to your forum. After that, it's as simple as clicking a button.

If you decide later that you want to remove the gibberish from your forum, this plugin can also do that.
