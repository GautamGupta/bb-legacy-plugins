History:
  Loosely based on the wordpress plugin 'easy LaTeX'
   by Manoj Thulasidas (www.thulasidas.com)


INSTALLATION:

1. Unzip bbLaTeX.zip into the my-plugins directory of your bbPress
    installation
2. Go to the admin page and in the 'plugins' menu you should see a
    submenu 'bbLaTeX configuration'.  Follow the instructions there.

In slightly more detail, the plugin needs a cache to work.  The plugin will
tell you what to do to get this cache, but the basic steps are:

1. chmod 777 <directory containing bbLaTeX.php>
2. Click on the 'create cache' directory
3. chmod 755 <directory containing bbLaTeX.php>

If you want to put the cache somewhere else, that's fine.  Just change the
relevant option on the configuration page.

REQUIREMENTS:

php with the GD library compiled in.

This script uses a public latex server so does not require latex to be
installed on the local system.

USAGE:

The configuration panel gives several options for font size, colours, and so
forth.  These should be self-explanatory.  Note that the background
transparency works by setting one colour to be transparent so there can be
"edge effects" round the text.  It is probably best to set the background to
be white or black when using transparency.

To use in posts, surround the mathematics by the appropriate tags and it will
be converted into an image.  The image is cached so that the server only gets
hit once per unique request.

OTHER NOTES:

The script actually translates the tags into an "internal standard", which is
the dummy '<bblatex> .. </bblatex>' tag.  This means that changing the input
tags later on does not change earlier posts - the mathematics is displayed
exactly as it was before.  As well as this robustness, this makes it easier
for other filters to ignore the mathematics (e.g. markdown can be easily told
to ignore bblatex tags), and means that if the cache is lost then everything
can be easily rebuilt.


TO DO:

* When editing a post, the mathematics is displayed as being between <bblatex>
tags, this should probably be changed to the current tag.

* Allow for easy switching from a latex server to, say, a mimetex server
(currently requires editing the code).
