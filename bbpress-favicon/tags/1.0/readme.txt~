Adds a custom favicon to all bbPress pages! Compliments my WordPress/MU Favicon Plugin!

== Description ==

This plugin is based off of code from my plugin, <a href="http://rohan-kapoor.com/projects/plugins/wordpress-mu-favicon/">WordPress MU Favicon</a. While that plugin sticks a favicon on all WordPress Pages, this one sticks on all bbPress Pages It's useful for community sites that want to apply a favicon sitewide. As of now, unfortunately you need to manually enter the location of the favicon. Soon there will be an admin interface set up for it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bbpress-favicon.php` to the `/bb-plugins/` directory (if you are using wordpress)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in bbPress.
3. The Plugin works!
4. Edit the uploaded plugin file with the location of the the favicon.
