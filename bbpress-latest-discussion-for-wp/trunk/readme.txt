This plugin will generates Latest Discussion list from your bbpress forum into your wordpress. It has the ability to generate latest discussion on sidebar also.

The administrator can also set the behavior for this plugin. Even if your bbpress is not intergrated with your wordpress. U still can use this plugin with a little change on the option page.

Simply download the Zip-Archive and extract all files into your wp-content/plugins/ directory. Open the `BBpress.php` file using editor program and adjust the path to suit your bbpress location. Then go into your WordPress administration page, click on Plugins and activate it.

== Configuration ==

1. `wp_bb_get_discuss()` : Show Bbpress latest discussion on wp static page.
2. `wp_bb_get_discuss_sidebar()` : Show Bbpress latest discussion on wp sidebar.
