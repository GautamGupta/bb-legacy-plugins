A set of tools to help moderate your forums.

== Description ==

bbPress Moderation Suite is a set of tools to help moderate your forums. There are multiple parts, each able to function separately from the others. You can activate or deactivate each part separately.  It even includes an uninstaller so if you don't want to use a part anymore, you can remove all of its database usage!

*Remember to tell me (either on my blog or on this plugin page) if you find anything that isn't working at "100% awesome".*

= Report =

Report allows users on your forum to report posts to the moderators on your forum. Believe me, if your moderators go on your forums regularly, they'll see the reports very quickly.

= Ban Plus =

Ban Plus allows temporary bans with notes on why the ban occurred. There are safety features to prevent Moderators from banning Keymasters.

[The "you've been banned" page can be customized.](http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bbpress-moderation-suite/other_notes/)

= Warning =

Allows moderators to warn users about rule breaking.

= Mod Log =

Keeps track of important moderator actions.

It logs the following actions:

* Plugins
	* Activation
	* Deactivation
* Forums
	* Deletion
* Users
	* Bozo (on, off)
	* Deletion
	* Banning (via Ban Plus)
* Posts
	* Status change (delete, spam, undelete, unspam)
	* Editing (by other users)

[There is a plugin API to allow more logged actions to be added.](http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bbpress-moderation-suite/other_notes/)

== Installation ==

1. If you do not have a `my-plugins` folder, make one now in the same place as the folder `bb-admin`.
1. Upload the entire `bbpress-moderation-suite` folder into your `my-plugins` folder.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in bbPress
1. Activate the parts of bbPress Moderation Suite that you would like to use and leave the others alone.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The Report plugin isn't putting a report link anywhere =

Your theme is using old functions.  Find `<?php post_ip_link(); ?> <?php post_edit_link(); ?> <?php post_delete_link(); ?>` or the like in your current theme's `post.php` file and change it to `<?php bb_post_admin(); ?>`.  If there's an if statement before it, delete that too.

= How do I solve issue X? =

== Screenshots ==

1. The moderation helper (de)activation system.

== Ban Plus API ==
If a `ban-plus.php` file is found in the template directory, it will be loaded with a global variable `$ban` that includes:

* `type` - So far this is always 'temp'
* `length` - The duration of the ban in seconds
* `on` - The unix timestamp of the ban starting
* `until` - The unix timestamp of the ban ending
* `banned_by` - The user ID of the person who started the ban
* `notes` - Any notes left by the person who started the ban

Here's an example of what a `ban-plus.php` template might look like:

`<?php bb_get_header(); ?>

<div class="notice error" id="message"><p>You have been blocked from the forum until 
<?php echo bb_datetime_format_i18n( $ban['until'] ); ?>, starting on <?php echo bb_datetime_format_i18n( $ban['on'] ); ?>. This ban will last <?php echo bb_since( time() - $ban['length'], true ); ?> in total. Your ban will end in <?php echo bb_since( time() * 2 - $ban['until'], true ); ?>. The reason for the ban was:</p><?php echo $ban['notes']; ?></div>

<?php bb_get_footer(); ?>`

== Mod Log API ==
To log other actions - for example, those caused by an unrelated plugin - use `bbmodsuite_modlog_log( $content, $type )`

In order to define a new type, you will have to add a filter to `bbmodsuite_modlog_get_type_description` and return the user friendly version if the non-user friendly version is given. For example, you could return `Topic deletion` if the argument to the function is `topic_delete`, and otherwise just return the argument.
