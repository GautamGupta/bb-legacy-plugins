Clickcha is a very unique & secure CAPTCHA that requires just one click instead of typing characters.

== Description ==

Clickcha is a unique CAPTCHA system that more secure than traditional text based CAPTCHAs yet easier to use. Clickcha will replace the submit button with an image based CAPTCHA that requires a single click to solve *and* post the form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Clickcha work? =

Clickcha generates image based CAPTCHAs which require the user to click the image in a particular area to solve the puzzle.

= Is Clickcha better than Akismet? =

That is not a proper comparison. Akismet blocks comment spam by analyzing its content while Clickcha does so by using a very unique CAPTCHA that simple for humans but almost impossible for bots to solve. I would suggest using Clickcha in conjunction with Akismet for best results.

= Is JavaScript required to comment? =

Yes, Clickcha plugin for bbPress does require Javascript (we might add an option to make it work without Javascript in the future).

= Are Cookies required to comment? =

No, Clickcha does not use cookies.

= What happens with pingbacks and trackbacks? =

Clickcha does not filter pingbacks and trackbacks.

= Does Clickcha support other languages? =

Not at the moment but multi-language support will be added soon. If you wish to help with the translations please write to [contact us](http://clickcha.com/feedback/ "Contact").

= Can you add a feature X? =

Let me know, I will try if its useful enough and I have time for it.
