== Description ==

Blocks the alternate Display Name functionality in bbPress 1.x to prevent spoofing other members/admin.

While some are fond of it, I've never liked the Display Name ability in WordPress as it's open to abuse. 

Now that bbPress has it, here's a way to disable it if you wish. Forces the user's login name to be used always.

== Installation ==

* Install, activate, and check profile edit page to see it's working.  No edits required.

== Changelog ==

= Version 0.0.1 (2008-11-09) =

* Disable Display Name is born

= Version 0.0.2 (2008-12-26) =

* post author fix

== To Do ==

* maybe allow administrators and moderators have display names but not regular members
