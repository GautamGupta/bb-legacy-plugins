== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the plugin options page? =

This plugin is all automatic, there are no options to configure!

= Will these links "leak" my PR? =

No. The links that are generated use `rel="nofollow"` in the markup. The generated links also use `target="_blank"` so that you won't be sending users away from your site when they click each link.

= I've found a bug, where do I report it? =

Please report all bugs via the post form below for quickest response and notation time. Otherwise, you can choose to email me via the [contact form](http://gaut.am/contact) located on my site
