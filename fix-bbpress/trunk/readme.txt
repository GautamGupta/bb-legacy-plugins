None necessary.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to delete this plugin when I download a future release of bbPress? =

No.  You should delete it, just to keep things tidy, but the plugin will only run for the one particular version of bbPress it was
designed for.  It won't hurt anything to have it installed with a different version of bbPress.
