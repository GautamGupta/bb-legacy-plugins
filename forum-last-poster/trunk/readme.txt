Adds `forum_last_poster()`, `forum_time()`, `forum_last_post_link()` and other functions to bbPress to mimic the topic tables' FRESHNESS column. Requires simple template edits.

== Description ==

Adds `forum_last_poster()`, `forum_time()`, `forum_last_post_link()` and other functions to bbPress to mimic the topic tables' FRESHNESS column. Requires simple template edits.

High performance: uses only a single extra query regardless of the number of forums listed (when topics are on same page).

== Installation ==

* Install `forum-last-posters.php` to  `my-plugins/` and activate

* Edit your `front-page.php` and/or `forum.php` templates to add  FRESHNESS column in the forum list like so:
`<table id="forumlist">

<tr>
	<th><?php _e('Main Theme'); ?></th>
	<th><?php _e('Freshness'); ?></th>
	<th><?php _e('Topics'); ?></th>
	<th><?php _e('Posts'); ?></th>
</tr>

<?php while ( bb_forum() ) : ?>
<tr<?php bb_forum_class(); ?>>
	<td class="num"><?php bb_forum_pad( '<div class="nest">' ); ?><a href="<?php forum_link(); ?>"><?php forum_name(); ?></a><small><?php forum_description(); ?></small><?php bb_forum_pad( '</div>' ); ?></td>
	<td class="num"><?php forum_time(); ?></td>
	<td class="num"><?php forum_topics(); ?></td>
	<td class="num"><?php forum_posts(); ?></td>
</tr>
`
(Notice the new Freshness and `forum_time()` lines, compared to the default template)

*  You may also use any of the other topic-like functions in any combination, see the FAQ for the list.

* You may specify a specifc forum by id if using a custom query/template, ie. `forum_time(3)` - otherwise it will automatically figure out the current forum id from the forum loop

== Changelog ==

= Version 0.0.1 (2008-07-24) =

* first public alpha release

= Version 0.0.3 (2008-08-16) =

* unfortunately the join query does not handle deleted topics correctly and returns no results for that forum, so have to use subquery :-(

= Version 0.0.4 (2008-01-04) =

* cache non-indexed query
* compatibility with bbPress 1.0a5+

== To Do ==

* instead of "expensive" mysql lookup for every page load, data could be stored upon every new post or deletion - since bbPress 1.0 will have meta for forums (0.9 does not) I will look at this again later
