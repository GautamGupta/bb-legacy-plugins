Set custom topic or post count limits for nearly every kind of bbPress page while still calculating direct post links correctly. (now 1.0 compatible)

== Description ==

Set custom topic or post count limits for nearly every kind of bbPress page while still calculating direct post links correctly. (now 1.0 compatible)

== Installation ==

* Edit the top of the `topics-per-page.php` file to change the number of topics or posts you want on each kind of page

* Add the `topics-per-page.php` file to bbPress' `my-plugins/` directory

* Activate plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where's the admin menu? =

* Since the settings in this plugin will likely be edited only once and then left forever, an admin menu would only slow bbPress down

* mdawaffe has instructed me to completely replace front-page-topics with this plugin
