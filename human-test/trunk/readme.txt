Uses various methods to exclude bots from registering (and eventually posting) on bbPress, including math, captcha and "negative fields".

== Description ==

Bot registration is becoming a problem on bbPress. 
This will slow them down if not stop them entirely.

Simply adds a new field at the bottom of your registration page with two random numbers to add together. 
Uses a few tricks like javascript and entity encoding to slow down the smarter bots.

(no core modifications required, 100% plugin based)

Optional image based (captcha style) writing coming soon as well as "negative fields".

== Instructions ==

Install, activate, and test your registration page.
