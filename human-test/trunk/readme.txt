Uses various methods to exclude bots from registering (and eventually posting) on bbPress, including math, captcha and "negative fields".

== Description ==

Automated bot registration is becoming a problem on bbPress. 
This is an easy way to stop virtually all of them.

This plugin adds a new field at the bottom of your registration page with two random numbers to add together. 
Uses a few tricks like javascript and entity encoding to slow down the smarter bots.

Now supports bb-anonymous-posting plugin with a challenge question automatically placed above posts/topics.

No template edits or core modifications required, 100% plugin based,

Eventually will add image based (captcha style) writing as well as "negative fields".

== Installation ==

* Install, activate, and test your registration page.  No edits required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
