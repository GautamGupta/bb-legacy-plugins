This will indicate posts made since the last login. This <em>REQUIRES</em> the <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/24">Simple Onlinelist</a> plugin by <a href="http://www.la-school.com/">Thomas Klaiber</a>.

== Description ==

This will slightly modify the default list of latest threads shown on the front page (of Kakumei, may differ depending on your theme) by highlighting (bolding) threads with posts made since the user was last online (timeout of about 5 min). It will not be highlighted if the last post is made by the user.

To modify the indication, modify the html code in line #41.

This work builds strongly upon Thomas Klaiber's <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/30">Since Last Visit</a> plugin; about half the code is his (more if you include the REQUIRED <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/24">Simple Onlinelist</a> plugin).

== Installation ==

Add the fel_newposts.php file to your my-plugins folder. No modification of the themes is necessary. Plugin activation is required for versions 1.0-alpha+
