Rails + bbPress Integration API
as seen at http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/integration-api/

This is a lot like the Rails + Wordpress Integration API (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rails-integration-api/).  

To install:

* get the Rails plugin (http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/integration_api and http://greenfabric.com/page/integration_api_home_page)  working 

* copy the 'integration-api' folder to your bbpress/my-plugins folder

* configure the settings for the bbPress Integration plugin

enjoy!
