Adds a "mass edit" feature to bbPress admin panel, similar to WordPress, for easily moderating posts in bulk.

== Description ==

With this plugin keymaster/administrators may view the most recent posts or search 
for posts by any author with any specific text and moderate the posts with delete/spam 
and undelete options. It's very similar to the "mass edit" feature built into WordPress.

== Installation ==

Add the `mass-edit.php` file to bbPress' `my-plugins/` directory.
Activate and check under "content" admin submenu for "Mass Edit".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* I am looking for feedback on more intuitive design colors, placement and options

* bbPress sometimes will generate an error when you delete a single post via the direct link - that is internal and I can't fix that, sorry
