bb-NoSpamUser blocks potential spammers from registering on your forum.

== Description ==
bb-NoSpamUser blocks potential spammers from registering on your forum by checking with [Stop Forum Spam](http://www.stopforumspam.com/) for IP address, email address, and username.

The spam checks are cached for 7 days to lessen the load on [Stop Forum Spam](http://www.stopforumspam.com/) and your own server. Optionally, a reCAPTCHA can be shown to lesser spammers to allow false positives to be bypassed.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire `nospamuser` folder to the `my-plugins` folder at the root of your forums.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in bbPress admin.
3. Modify the settings in the administration panel.
