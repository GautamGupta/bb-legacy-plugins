Adds page peel to your blog.

== Description ==

Adds a page peel in the corner of the site... with jQuery! no Flash :D

Based on the work by Soh Tanaka: http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/simple-page-peel-effect-with-jquery-css/

If your theme's stylesheet modifies the body's width, PageCornr will look bad. Use a Wrapper and modify the width from it. In that way, PageCornr will stay in the corner.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of `page-cornr.zip` to `/my-plugins/page-cornr` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in bbPress
3. Go to 'Settings', 'Page Cornr Options', where you can set the ad's URL and the altertative text.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the images? =

Yes, you can. You only need to edit the two images in the directory 'images' of this plugin. It also includes the .psd files for your convenience.

= Does it works with IE? =

Yes! IE 6 included!

= If you speak Spanish, why the hell did you do this plugin in English?! =

Wow, take it easy ;). The next version will be translatable and will include the translation into Spanish. So... relax :D

= Any warning? =

Well, yeah. If your theme's stylesheet modifies the body's width, PageCornr will look bad. Use a Wrapper and modify the width from it. In that way, PageCornr will stay in the corner.
