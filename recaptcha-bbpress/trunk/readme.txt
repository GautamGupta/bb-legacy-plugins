== Description ==
Protect your forum from spam registrations by using <a href="http://www.recaptcha.net">Recaptcha</a>.

== Installation ==
Create a folder called "recaptcha" in your bb-plugins directory. Unzip all files into that directory.

You will need to sign up for a Recaptcha Account. You can do that at <a href="https://admin.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/createsite/">https://admin.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/createsite/</a>

On signing up, you will receive two keys, a public key and a private key. In the bbpress admin, browse to Plugins > reCaptcha bbPress, and put in the public/private keys in there.

== FAQ ==

<strong>I have an error even when insterted both keys.</strong><br/>
For some reason, I find that you may need to put in a trailing space when inserting the public/private keys, check if it's present.
== Shameless Begging ==
