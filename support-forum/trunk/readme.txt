Requires at least: 0.9

Stable tag: 3.0.5

Adds the ability to set a support status on topics in selected forums.

== Description ==

This plugin creates an option to convert forums within a bbPress installation
into support forums where the users can mark the topics as resolved, not
resolved or not a support question.

The administrator can also set the default status of the topics, and which
statuses have special views.

You can select if the original poster has the ability to set the status on
topic creation and whether they can change the status later.

Three additional options add a visual marker to each topic to indicate it's
support, locked or sticky status.

* Not a support question = empty slot
* Unresolved = red ball (alternative orange ball also provided)
* Resolved = green ball
* Locked = padlock
* Sticky = star

Version 3.0 of this plugin removes support for bbPress versions prior to
bbPress 0.9. A maintenance branch of the 2.3 version of this plugin is
available which will remain updated with security fixes, but no new
functionality will be added. The 2.3 branch is available here:

http://plugins-dev.bbpress.org/browser/support-forum/branches/2.3

== Installation ==

1. If you don't have a /my-plugins/ directory in your bbpress installaltion, 
   create it on the same level as config.php.

2. Upload the file into /my-plugins/ directory

3. Also copy the PNG images into the my-plugins directory. There is an
   alternative icon for the "no" status which is orange instead of red, rename
   as required.

4. If you are migrating from version 1.0 of the plugin, go to the
   administration area and update the topics to the new format

Configuration can be carried out within the admin area of bbPress, you
will need to be logged in as a keymaster.
