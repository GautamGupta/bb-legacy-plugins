Watches a Subversion repository and enters data into bbPress.

== Description ==

This plugin is a little over engineered, but still manages to be non-robust in a few scenarios.

It's goal is to watch (and in some cases administrate) an SVN repository and take action when it changes, all while being compatible with a mulitple server environment.  The files included in this plugin, for example, can convert a bbPress install into a user-facing interface of your subversion repository.

In its current state, the plugin is unsupported.  There are a few large architectural changes on the horizon as well.  Use at your own risk.
