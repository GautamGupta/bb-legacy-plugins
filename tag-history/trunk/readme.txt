Helps administrators figure out who tagged what, when, by exploring tagging history.

With this plugin administrators may explore the complete tag history of all topics by all users.

This can be helpful to make sure spammers have not snuck in any tags or find misbehaving new users.

== Installation ==

Add the entire `tag-history/` directory to the bbPress `my-plugins/` directory.

Activate and check under the "Manage" menu for the new "Tags" submenu.
