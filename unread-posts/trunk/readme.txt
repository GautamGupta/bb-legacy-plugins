Indicates previously read topics with new unread posts across most types of pages within bbPress. Features "mark all topics read". 

== Description ==

This is not just "yet another" Show Unread Posts plugin.
Builds on concepts by fel64 and henrybb with feature and performance improvements. 
No additional plugins or tables required. Produces no overhead for non-members and as little as possible otherwise.
Users can be given a link to "mark all topics read" and you can adjust the number of topics to track to limit bloat.
Topics with new posts can be customized via css styles, ie. bold, underline, colors, or even an icon.

To see a demonstration, create an account at http://bbShowcase.org read some posts and wait for some replies.

== Instructions ==

Install, activate, optionally edit unread style and number of topics tracked per user within unread-posts.php
If you'd like to give users the ability to "mark all topics read", simply place the following html in your template:
<a href="?mark_all_topics_read">Mark all topics as read</a>
