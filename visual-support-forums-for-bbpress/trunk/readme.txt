== Description ==

This plugin adds a visual marker to each topic to indicate it's support/locked
status.

 * Not a support question = empty slot
 * Unresolved = red ball (alternative orange ball also provided)
 * Resolved = green ball
 * Locked = padlock

This plugin is an extension for the Support Forums plugin by Aditya Naik and
requires it to be installed to work.

== Installation ==

This plugin requires the Support Forums plugin by Aditya Naik. So go
and install that first.

Download and unzip the file and copy the visual-support-forum.php file into the
my-plugins directory.

Also copy the PNG images into the my-plugins directory. There is an alternative
icon for the "no" status which is orange instead of red, rename as required.

No further configuration is required.
