Provides WordPress admin access from bbPress!

== Description ==

This plugin was created to allow WordPress, WordPress MU, and BuddyPress to be administered from the bbPress Administration Panels. It is a very basic plugin and uses iframes to provide access to WordPress. It is known to compatible with WordPress and WordPress MU 2.8.x and bbPress 1.x.x. As it just uses iframes to connect to WordPress, ideally, it will still be compatible with all upcoming versions of bbPress and WordPress. It no longer needs direct editing to set your path to your forums directory!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wordpress_admin.php` to the `/my-plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in bbPress
3. View WordPress Administration Panels in "Tools/WordPress Admin"
