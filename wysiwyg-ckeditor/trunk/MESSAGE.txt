Hello!
This is open message from author to my plugin's users.

Some users tell that my plugin is not working for them,
but solo i'm unable to determine why. On my site it works fine.

If the plugin does not work for you - please, help me to fix it!

If you are a programmer - you can try to fix it yourself,
the plugin is very simple.

If not, but you have a live forum where you tested the plugin -
please, provide the adress of your forum.

Watch for JavaScript errors in your browser!

also, you may contact me directly, if you want.
post your ICQ, email or skype in some format that is not readable by bots
