Hide/Lock of forums/topics.

== Description ==

zaerl Visibility adds the possibility to hide/lock forums/topics. Forums or single topics can be hidden/locked for specific roles and/or for a list of users. An hidden forum/post doesn't show on pages and RSS. A locked forum is closed to new topics. A locked topic is closed to new replies which is different from the built-in "closed" status that deny the possibility of replying to all users. You can specify super users and super roles that aren't affected by all other rules.
